1. I chose NodeJS and Express for this coding excercise because I am comfortable with them,
and they are designed for building web applications and APIs. I wanted to keep the amount of 
libraries low as well to keep the code more clean and easy to understand. 

2. The advantages of my solution are that the code is readable and not hard to follow, although some parts
are not extremely efficient. One example of this is the transactions array, which I currently sort each 
time a spent POST request is sent. I beleived this is more efficient than using a more complex data structure
when the amount of transactions are low, but if the amount of transactions were to increase, it would become slow,
and using a min-Heap would be better.

3. A favorite personal project that I built was a web application I built for a hackathon. Working with a 
team proved to be more challenging than writing all the code myself at first, but throughout the competition
I learned to coordinate with my teammates better and eventually managed to win!
